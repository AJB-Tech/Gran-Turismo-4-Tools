# Gran-Turismo-4-Tools
A tool to simplify the process of memory editing Gran Turismo 4 NTSC on PCSX2. Allows the user to select a random grid of AI cars and a random track, or a custom choice based on a CSV list of the vehicles and tracks in game, along with their internal code names. Also allows the user to adjust the field of view and car-attachment-rigidity of the chase camera.

Not the cleanest code, but it works!
